   - **Webhook**: Uncheck (not needed for this listing)

3. Click "Create GitHub App"

### Step 2: Upload Your Icon
- Use the icon we created at `assets/icon.svg`
- Or create your own 128x128px or larger PNG icon

### Step 3: Apply for GitHub Marketplace
1. Go to your GitHub App settings
2. Click "Apply for GitHub Marketplace"
3. Fill out the application form:
   - **Listing name**: AI Productivity Tools Bundle

   - **Pricing**: Choose Free or paid ($19 for Pro Bundle)
   - **Categories**: Education, Productivity

### Step 4: Submit for Review
- Submit your application
- GitHub will review within a few days

## Files Ready for Marketplace
- `assets/icon.svg` - App icon (convert to PNG before uploading)
- `PRIVACY.md` - Privacy policy
- `.github/app.yml` - App configuration

## Tips for Approval
1. Make sure your app has a clear purpose
2. Include proper privacy policy
3. Provide good screenshots of your tools
4. Be responsive during review process

## Alternative: List as a Template Repository
Instead of GitHub Marketplace, you can also:
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Check "Template repository"
3. This makes it easy for others to fork and use
